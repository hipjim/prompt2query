# Contributing to Prompt2Query

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Prompt2Query! It's people like you that make Prompt2Query such a great tool.

## Getting Started

Before you begin:
- Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** — check if the issue has already been reported.
2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** — try to reproduce it using the latest `main` branch.
3. **Isolate the problem** — create a reduced test case and a live example.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** — check if the enhancement has already been suggested.
2. **Determine which repository the enhancement should be suggested in**.
3. **Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature** you want and why it's important to add.
4. **Explain how this enhancement would be useful** to most Prompt2Query users.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:
- Maintain Prompt2Query's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Prompt2Query
- Enable a sustainable system for Prompt2Query's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2. **Install all dependencies** using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Make your changes** in your forked repository.
4. **Add tests** for your changes, if applicable.
5. **Ensure the test suite passes**.
6. **Follow the code style** of the project, including indentation.
7. **Add or update documentation** as needed.
8. **Submit a pull request** to the original repository.
